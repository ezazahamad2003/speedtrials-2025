- **Features**:
  - Water systems analysis
  - Violations breakdown
  - Sampling data analysis
  - Geographic coverage
  - Facilities overview
  - Data quality assessment
- **Output**: Comprehensive insights into each data domain

### Step 6: Analysis Execution
- **Action**: Ran both analysis scripts
- **Results**:
  - Successfully analyzed all 10 files
  - Generated statistics and insights
  - Identified data quality issues
  - Extracted key metrics

### Step 7: File Organization
- **Action**: Created `analysis/` folder to store all analysis files
- **Files Moved**: 
  - `detailed_analysis.py` â†’ `analysis/detailed_analysis.py`
- **Purpose**: Keep analysis work organized and preserved

### Step 8: Report Generation
- **Action**: Created comprehensive markdown report
- **File**: `analysis/CSV_Analysis_Report.md`
- **Content**:
  - Executive summary
  - File-by-file analysis
  - Key insights
  - Recommendations
  - Technical considerations

### Step 9: Documentation
- **Action**: Created this steps log
- **Purpose**: Record all analysis steps for future reference
- **Content**: Chronological log of all actions taken

## Key Technical Decisions

### Data Loading Strategy
- Used pandas with `low_memory=False` for large files
- Handled mixed data types in violations file
- Preserved original data structure

### Analysis Approach
- Started with basic statistics
- Progressed to detailed domain-specific analysis
- Focused on actionable insights for application development

### File Organization
- Created dedicated analysis folder
- Preserved all analysis scripts
- Generated comprehensive documentation

## Tools and Technologies Used

### Command Line Tools
- PowerShell for file operations
- Python for data analysis
- Git for version control

### Python Libraries
- pandas for data manipulation
- numpy for numerical operations
- pathlib for file operations

### Analysis Techniques
- Descriptive statistics
- Data quality assessment
- Geographic analysis
- Compliance tracking analysis

## Challenges Encountered

### Technical Challenges
1. **Large File Sizes**: 30.5MB violations file required special handling
2. **Mixed Data Types**: Some columns had inconsistent data types
3. **Memory Constraints**: Large files required efficient loading strategies

### Data Quality Issues
1. **Missing Contact Information**: 55.6% missing email addresses
2. **Geographic Data Gaps**: Some ZIP code data missing
3. **Inconsistent Dates**: Date format variations across files

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Efficient Loading**: Used low_memory=False and chunked reading
2. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks for robust analysis
3. **Data Validation**: Checked for missing data and inconsistencies

## Next Steps Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing contact information
2. **Validation**: Verify geographic data completeness
3. **Documentation**: Create data dictionary for application developers

### Application Development
1. **Database Design**: Design efficient schema for the 10 tables
2. **API Development**: Create endpoints for different user types
3. **UI/UX Design**: Design interfaces for public, operators, and regulators

### Quality Assurance
1. **Data Validation**: Implement data quality checks
2. **Performance Testing**: Test with large violation datasets
3. **User Testing**: Validate with target user groups

## Files Created During Analysis

1. `analysis/detailed_analysis.py` - Detailed analysis script
2. `analysis/CSV_Analysis_Report.md` - Comprehensive report
3. `analysis/Analysis_Steps_Log.md` - This steps log

## Data Summary

- **Total Files Analyzed**: 10 CSV files
- **Total Records**: 238,716 records
- **Total Data Size**: 37.5 MB
- **Active Water Systems**: 2,380
- **Total Violations**: 151,084
- **Health-Based Violations**: 15,339
- **Geographic Coverage**: 159 counties

## Conclusion

The analysis successfully examined all 10 CSV files and provided comprehensive insights into Georgia's water quality data. The dataset is well-suited for building applications that serve public users, water system operators, and regulatory agencies. Key strengths include complete geographic coverage and comprehensive violation tracking, while areas for improvement include contact information completeness.
