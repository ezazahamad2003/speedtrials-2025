## Recommendations for Application Development

### For Public Users
- Focus on active water systems (2,380) rather than all systems
- Prioritize health-based violations in displays
- Include geographic search by county/city
- Provide clear violation explanations and health implications

### For Water System Operators
- Emphasize monitoring and reporting compliance
- Include facility-specific information
- Provide contact information for regulatory agencies
- Track compliance deadlines and milestones

### For Regulators
- Comprehensive violation tracking and enforcement history
- Geographic distribution of violations and compliance
- Facility inspection and evaluation results
- Population impact assessments

## Technical Considerations

### Data Relationships
- **Primary Key**: PWSID (Public Water System ID) links all tables
- **Time Period**: All data from Q1 2025 (SUBMISSIONYEARQUARTER)
- **Geographic Linking**: Multiple geographic identifiers available
- **Violation Tracking**: Comprehensive violation and enforcement history

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Violations File**: 30.5 MB with 151K records requires efficient querying
- **Geographic Queries**: Multiple geographic identifiers for flexible searching
- **Time-based Analysis**: Historical violation and compliance data available

### Data Gaps
- **Contact Information**: Significant missing email addresses
- **Geographic Data**: Some ZIP code data missing
- **Sample Measurements**: Some measurement data may be incomplete
